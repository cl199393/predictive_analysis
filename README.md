# Towards Actionable Recommendations for Exam Preparation Using Isomorphic Problem Banks and Explanatory Machine Learning
 
The goal of this project is to enhance exam preparation strategies by leveraging isomorphic problem banks and explainable machine learning techniques.

## Code Path
├── Feature_Importance.R              # R script for computing feature importance using base model \\
├── Feature_Importance_transfer.R     # R script for computing feature importance using transfer learning or an adapted model
