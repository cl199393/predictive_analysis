# Towards Actionable Recommendations for Exam Preparation Using Isomorphic Problem Banks and Explanatory Machine Learning
 
The goal of this project is to enhance exam preparation strategies by leveraging isomorphic problem banks and explainable machine learning techniques.

## Code Path
These R scripts analyze feature importance from machine learning models used in the project.
### 1. Run feature importance analysis on the base model:
```R
source("code/Feature_Importance.R")
source("code/Feature_Importance_transfer.R")

### 2. Run SHAP analysis for the best performance model:
```Python
source("code/SHAP.ipynb")
